1. File format

Valid records should contain at least 3 fields seperated by comma
<context>,<call>,<explanation>,<comment>
where <context> represents the bidding before <call>. <explanation> is the text to accompany tha alerted call.
<comment> field is optional. Spaces or tabs are allowed at the beginning or end of each field for better readability.

Empty lines are allowed for better readability
Comment lines like this are ignored

Example :
    1C--1D--1H--,	1N,		explanation text, 

Note -- which represents passed oponents. Instead of -- you can use double underscore __ as wild card
if the meaning of the call does not depend of eventual overcalls made by oponents.
In the example below, the meaning of each of each call remains the same, even if oponents bid.
    1C__1D__1H__,	1N,		explanation text,

The opening bid must begin with empty field
    ,1C,16+HCP strong artificial and forcing,Comment: this is the strong opening bid of Precision System

The negative response to 1C opening is 1D
The bidding context is 1C-- which means opening 1C followed by opponent's pass (-- code)
    1C--,1D,0-7 HCP artificial
    1C--,2H,6-card !H suit robust 4-6 HCP
    1C--,2S,6-card !S suit robust 4-6 HCP
    1C--2H--,2N,asking bid (for singleton or void)
    1C--2S--,2N,asking bid (for singleton or void)

Opener's rebid after 1D response will be coded
    1C--1D--,1N,17-19 HCP balanced hand
    1C--1D--,1H,5+!Hs or 20+HCP balanced
    1C--1D--,1S,5+!Ss 16-21 HCP not forcing
    1C--1D--,2C,5+!Cs 16-21 HCP not forcing
    1C--1D--,2D,5+!Ds 16-21 HCP not forcing

    1C--1D--,2H,5+!Ds 16-21 HCP not forcing
    1C--1D--,2S,5+!Ds 16-21 HCP not forcing

    1C--1D--,3C,very strong long !Cs unbal forcing
    1C--1D--,3D,very strong long !Ds unbal forcing

    1C--1D--,3H,solid !Hs very strong forcing
    1C--1D--,3S,solid !Ss very strong forcing

    1C--1D--,4H,stronger than Namyats
    1C--1D--,4S,stronger than Namyats

Similar after the 1H overcall after 1D
    1C--1D1H,1N,17-19 HCP balanced hand !H stopped
    1C--1D1S,1N,17-19 HCP balanced hand !S stopped

If the opening is seat sensitive you should mention explicitly initial passes
    ----,1H,9-14HCP 4+!S
    ----1S--,2C,10-11 HCP Drury after initial pass

Our own overcalls after opponent's opening are represented by code
    1H,2N,minor two-suiter

For better readability leading spaces or tabs are allowed
    1H,     2N,     minor two-suiter

If the same bidding sequence is defined twice, only the last one will be considered.
Typical situation when, during the game, you modify the explanation for the alerted call.
Any modification made during the game will appear in the clipboard (paste at the end of the existing table).
In the comment field you will find the time stamp and the deal number for eventual review.

If the explanation text excceds 39 characters, you can use # character to split it in to parts.
The first will appear in the explanation field of the bidding box, the second part in the chat box.
You should send the chat message to the opponents manually. Example :
    ,1D,Short explanation text#Long chat message text limited to 249 characters

Keyboard abbreviations can be defined :
    Shortcut,   TC,   Texas !C
    Shortcut,   TD,   Texas !D
    Shortcut,   TH,   Texas !H
    Shortcut,   TS,   Texas !S
    Shortcut,   XX,   to avoid long line wrapping in the text editor \
                      you can use backslash to continue in the next line
    Shortcut,   BW,   Blackwood 4-1,3-0 (5 key cards)
    Shortcut,   ML,   Multiline text\nLine 2\nLine 3\n

or Alt-key shortcuts :
    Shortcut,	AltA, Hello. You pressed ALt-A key

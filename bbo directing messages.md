Crash beyond our control.

Substituting a specific player for the Sitout
What DOES work-Use the Substitutes entry in Tournament Menu! Type ‘sitout’ and the name of your player. Repeat.
Alternatively, at the red username, choose sub any and then replace the sub with your specified username. (???is this rude to the random sub?)
(What does NOT work (at present)-click on the red username in the Table list or at the table-this is a bug and will be fixed at some point.)

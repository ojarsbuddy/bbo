## tournament beginning

🔌🔌🔌 The robots say your partner shows offline to BBO. 🔌🔌🔌

🔌🔌🔌 Your robot reports you offline to BBO. 🔌🔌🔌

🔌🔌🔌 Surveillance robot reports you offline to BBO. 🔌🔌🔌

4 partners offline or inactive on BBO. Where is your partner now?

The near miss crew are just logging on now.

Players cutting it close to the start time: BBO does not seat your pair if one of you is offline or one of you is online but inactive on BBO or one of you has insufficient BBO funds.

Hail, Hail, the Gang's All Here

And they're off!

We filled the seats today -- perhaps another time?

This is an invitational club and members invite the guests.

## after the start

♥ Please do not call TD for unfinished board adjustment unless you think an error has been made. We get a list to review every round and will adjust if result is clear. Answering TD calls about them only slows us down, TY for patience

Crash beyond our control.

Substituting a specific player for the Sitout
What DOES work-Use the Substitutes entry in Tournament Menu! Type ‘sitout’ and the name of your player. Repeat.
Alternatively, at the red username, choose sub any and then replace the sub with your specified username. (???is this rude to the random sub?)
(What does NOT work (at present)-click on the red username in the Table list or at the table-this is a bug and will be fixed at some point.)

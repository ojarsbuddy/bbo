# Replacing a Robot

Sometime the usual sustitution protocols work. When those fail there remains a way to get the job done.

1. Discover the Robot BBO ID.

2. In the Director tab click the game to reveal the dropdown menu and click the "Substitutes" option.

3. Fill the "Replace" entry with the entire name of the Robot. e.g., ~~M14027, including the two tildes.

4. Fill the "with" entry with the player BBO ID.

5. Use the "Substitute - select" option to permanently assign the player to that seat.

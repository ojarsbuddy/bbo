Invisible show up with white background in registrants list. Invisible show up with white backround in registrants list.

### Phil noted 7.09

It seems that ACBL/BBO fees are going up. I am fuzzy on the details.
They claim to have figured out the money for last month, still a few days before it gets sent.

There was a poll about how often the club would run an individual event.

It was pointed out that someone registered for our game and playing in another event would show up as online in vportal -- but they would not be available for our game until the one they were in finished

Table history has timestamps. It can be used to figure out who was slow, but it does not show individual time totals.

Ipads should be set to idle after 15 minutes. The default setting is much lower. This often leads to disconnects.

About cheating: to catch cheaters, they need players to report interesting results. File recorder forms. Do not expect swift action. One is not a trend. If there is enough smoke, they will look for a fire. This takes time. They want reports to be filed. They suggested that they suspect at least several hundred cheaters to exist.

They may be changing the schedule of these meetings.

## 2020.07.13

To give the extra credit for tables, insert the hack +LT=x+ into your game’s description sometime before the game ends. “x” is the number of additional tables to give the game credit for. If there is a half-table that you don’t fill with subs, you should round up.

Guest membership soft rolling out next week.

Adjusting scores can see robot names?

Post-pandemic plans -- online task force came back with suggestions.

### Phil noted 8.31

Starting with a robot and having your regular partner show up late and replace the robot COULD lead to a reduction in card fees. This is something BBO and ACBL do not desire.

There was mention that country clubs normally get 80% masterpoints because they are invitational. Officially ALL clubs are currently invitational. A method of having St. Andrews award 80% masterpoints was mentioned.

Board traveler is a big hit. Apparently Player History is also functional.

Zoom after the games may help build games, especially the limited. Charge a bit more?

Sanctioning discussions underway.

## 2020.10.12

Money process for September`` is begun.

Convention card requirement soon. Still running classes.

Look at table history to get a sense of timing.

### Phil noted 10.12

The times in show tables need not be correct. Especially for very slow pairs. BBO has been informed and is working on it.

Possibility of requiring convention cards for event registration. This is under discussion and might not apply to vacb games. Details to follow. I suspect that many will load a default card and play whatever they want.

Permitting undos was heatedly discussed without resolution.

Request for Silver points was made.

That is about it for the meeting.

Not adjusting the robots means whoever plays them has a tough draw. Perhaps we should offer the choice of: play the robots and it counts or, take a sitout (at least for the early rounds). There is some risk in letting them play 15 boards instead of 18 as it slightly magnifies good games.

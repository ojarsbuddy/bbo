Invisible show up with white background in registrants list. Invisible show up with white backround in registrants list.

### Phil noted 7.09

It seems that ACBL/BBO fees are going up. I am fuzzy on the details.
They claim to have figured out the money for last month, still a few days before it gets sent.

There was a poll about how often the club would run an individual event.

It was pointed out that someone registered for our game and playing in another event would show up as online in vportal -- but they would not be available for our game until the one they were in finished

Table history has timestamps. It can be used to figure out who was slow, but it does not show individual time totals.

Ipads should be set to idle after 15 minutes. The default setting is much lower. This often leads to disconnects.

About cheating: to catch cheaters, they need players to report interesting results. File recorder forms. Do not expect swift action. One is not a trend. If there is enough smoke, they will look for a fire. This takes time. They want reports to be filed. They suggested that they suspect at least several hundred cheaters to exist.

They may be changing the schedule of these meetings.

## 2020.07.13

To give the extra credit for tables, insert the hack +LT=x+ into your game’s description sometime before the game ends. “x” is the number of additional tables to give the game credit for. If there is a half-table that you don’t fill with subs, you should round up.

Guest membership soft rolling out next week.

Adjusting scores can see robot names?

Post-pandemic plans -- online task force came back with suggestions.

### Phil noted 8.31

Starting with a robot and having your regular partner show up late and replace the robot COULD lead to a reduction in card fees. This is something BBO and ACBL do not desire.

There was mention that country clubs normally get 80% masterpoints because they are invitational. Officially ALL clubs are currently invitational. A method of having St. Andrews award 80% masterpoints was mentioned.

## 2020.09.07

Disciplined over 30 people -- officially. More cheating under investigation. Process does work, but it is not fast.

Next Club Appreciation no extra charge. Examining schedule for 2021.

Board traveler is a big hit. Apparently Player History is also functional.

Zoom after the games may help build games, especially the limited. Charge a bit more?

Sanctioning discussions underway.

## 2020.10.12

Money process for September is begun.

Convention card requirement soon. Still running classes.

Look at table history to get a sense of timing.

### Phil noted 10.12

The times in show tables need not be correct. Especially for very slow pairs. BBO has been informed and is working on it.

Possibility of requiring convention cards for event registration. This is under discussion and might not apply to vacb games. Details to follow. I suspect that many will load a default card and play whatever they want.

Permitting undos was heatedly discussed without resolution.

Request for Silver points was made.

That is about it for the meeting.

Not adjusting the robots means whoever plays them has a tough draw. Perhaps we should offer the choice of: play the robots and it counts or, take a sitout (at least for the early rounds). There is some risk in letting them play 15 boards instead of 18 as it slightly magnifies good games.

## 2020.10.19

Opening later this week the sanction process online.

More than one section hides the extra board detail. They will figure it out.

### Phil noted 10.19

face to face sanction renewals coming probably by end of month

suggestion: when director is summoned to a table -- the director should announce their presence

suggestion: involve the players -- possibly with a q&a or something either zoomish or email questions
with answers to SOME posted on a website

Greg let is slip that they ran an event where GIB did NOT adjudicate unfinished boards -- this may be an option for us -- presumably these boards received scores assigned by humans -- also means that those boards did not disappear from the directors dashboard until a human had reviewed them

discussion of 2 board vs 3 board rounds -- much talking with little resolution

A mini-crash of BBO on Thursday around 4:00 pm was acknowledged.

## 2020.10.26

@@@ Forgot the LT hack today -- can it still be fixed? @@@ email to Rick Beye

Schedule extra game in case the first crashes.

Sanction status and tournament list?

Convention cards again.

Minimum charge is \$3. Autoscheduler minumum charge is \$5? I thought it was \$4.

Team games around 50/50.

John mentioned his face to face game with tablets. The moderator offered to have a story with pictures in the Bulletin. John told him, the club does not allow cameras or phones. I did not mention the cameras in the tablets.

Phone numbers will return to vportal SOON.

Since covid started over 12 million \$ has been paid out to vacbs.

Side note: ACBL seems not to have a plan for returning to f2f bridge.
My opinion: online bridge will stay strong when f2f resumes. Someone mentioned players having to drive an hour to get to the game and preferring online.

Discussion of people not wanting to play online because of cheating. Pointed out that there is plenty of cheating f2f.

When f2f resumes, ACBL plans to give the clubs plenty of bonus point games -- details eventually.

Swiss testing going fairly well -- now a near future item.

New convention card.

Money ACBL is a pass through and no 1099 hence will be sent.

## 2021.01.18

Live for clubs back up after issues fixed.

Swiss teams got lots of testing. Full rollout coming.

Moving to 1st and 3rd Mondays of the month.

Club manager version of schedule
<http://web2.acbl.org/documentLibrary/Clubs/2021_Game_Schedule_Club_Manager.pdf>

Moving on doing undo function of some sort.

Problem with using hands rather than random -- game disappeared.

Howell with 8 tables or more the section award limit kicks in, i.e., fewer master points given out.

Suspended the big game listings.

Teaching on new alert procedures.

## 2021.02.01

Show tables hides when the window is resized. I have seeen that. The show tables window is outside the viewport of the original window. Just maximize the original window.

Swiss teams have no travelers.

New convention cards availablility. ACBL working on redesigns.

Set number of entries and make it equal to the number of registered to block new entries very close to game time.

Saving table history -- change url to go through the tables efficiently -- noted in the onboarding document.

## 2021.02.15

@@@ Live for clubs has been unstable -- what gives? "That damn gateway timeout again." @@@

Virtual club program manager hired -- Lynn Chapin (lynn.chapin@acbl.org).

Late on money -- but $3 million last month.

Scheduler does not work for Swiss. Still restricted to 1.5 masterpoints rather than 4. Swiss is not ready for Prime Time. Contracts missing. A pair signed up with one pair and another pair as teams! No stratifications. No table history.

<http://bridge.wespowers.com/BBOTableHistory.html> tool for capturing table histories.

@@@ One of our attendees is zooming from Iceland. @@@

<http://web2.acbl.org/documentLibrary/Clubs/2021_Game_Schedule_Club_Manager.pdf>

Email poolmaster@acbl.org to fix forgotten hacks -- lynn.chapin@acbl.org.

Swiss tips -- add time to next to last round at the beginning of that round to ensure proper pairings for last round.

Swiss still not part of the masterpoint engine process. Not set up for autoscheduler. Change max registrants to prevent pairs jumping in once the game is set. Still not ready for prime time.

Honors planning to open one venue beginning of April.

ACBLScore still will work for a long tome to come.

Cannot accidently make an illegal bid -- must be intentional.

Howell hack prevents splitting into sections.

Extra Zoom meeting next Monday traning for running Swiss Teams?

Checked at registration time for sufficient funds. People playing in instant tournaments or some such thing might drop funds below the requirements.

### Phil's notes

the bbo update did not happen, now expected Tomorrow
vacb will continue when f2f happens

Clubs | American Contract Bridge League – ACBL -- has vacb resource center worth a read by club manager

Clubs | American Contract Bridge League – ACBL

it links to VACB Resource Center not hosted at acbl

VACB Resource Center

send vacb questions to lynn.chapin@acbl.org

only VACB sees who is mucking up allavail -- other directors don't

vacb does not get the message of who is the problem if the offender is playing in another game

<http://cloud.bridgefinesse.com/ACBLF2FDashBoard.html> -- shows how many tables are doing face2face
I expect a jump in table count April 1st and another May 1st.

Virtual Clubs - Update -- the old document keeps getting updated, not official ACBL document but worth a review every now and then -- first 3 pages should do it (plus anything they reference)

Virtual Clubs - Update

discussion of sounds and settings in BBO -- some sounds annoy the spouse!

unclear what will happen to bonus vacb masterpoints when face2face is more prevalent -- acbl is thinking about it -- no details any time soon unless something changes

Request that during charity week, clubs be permitted to designate 1 day for a local charity. Suggestion well received by meeting attendees. Very unlikely to happen this go around.

## 2021.03.22

Running Swiss Teams Q&A Session

Still no stratification -- try Eight Is Enough format?

Instant launch trick - edit tournament run time down to 0 then modicfy tournament. Then edit tournament again and the game launches immediately.

Sub order -- take care! BBO has its own idea of where to put people.

## 2021.04.05

@@@ Combine face to face and virtual. @@@ Mid-April proposals coming.

@@@ View to resolution of egregious activity complaints. @@@ On the web-site.

Video launch did not go well. Will be a cost for video: $0.03 per player per board.

Substantial uptick in face to face. February it was 2500 tables and March was 3500 tables. Still a drop in the bucket.

Requiring vaccinations does not make the game invitational. Like having a shirt and shoes!

Reorganization of website to include virtual club interests.

Fixing Swiss and video.

Instant launch again - bring it to 0 minutes,modify, close, open it will see the -1's, then ...

Lovebridge platform. <https://lovebridge.com/>

ACBLScore not going away.

## 2021.04.19

@@@ Combine face to face and virtual. @@@ Same story as last meet.

Marketing talk by Mary Stratton.

Machine at each table dealing cards - Aviv.

Which convention chart is the club employing: Basic, Basic+, Open, Open+?

The Basic and Basic+ Charts are intended for limited master point events. These Charts are written in manner similar to the old charts --by listing permitted methods.

The Open and Open+ Charts are intended for events with no masterpoint limits (or high limits). In contrast to the Basic and Basic+ Charts, methods are generally allowed unless they are expressly prohibited within the Chart.

## 2021.05.03

@@@ Simultaneous play @@@ Sent email to Greg Coles and Lynn Chapin

Maximum BBO$ purchase is $200 at one time.

We can do NAP games.

The robot sitout idea to apply in combined games?

## 2021.05.17

@@@ Swapping declarer and dummy to get the robot out of the declarer position? @@@ Discussed with Uday but not high in the list -- apparently it is complicated.
@@@ Combine face to face and virtual. @@@ Will not happen.
@@@ Any suggestions as to a source for robots when we go face-to-face? @@@ The old idea with tablets or laptops. How about building a bridge playing robot?

+NAP+ hack. We can pick the games over three months. Extra $4 per table. Two per month?
Longest Day games have precedence. Same rule for Stardust game.
Might be last Silver Linings.

More clubs opening up. Still a small percentage: 15% of clubs but half the table count as before.

Profile pictures are back.

Addressing the masterpoints issued online versus face-to-face. Demand show vaccination proof - Aviv.

SYC games slowly going down but still raise $30,000 in a month.

Confident virtual clubs are here to stay.

Bridgemates issues?

Strats for Swiss is second on Uday's list. First is points shown by BBO.

Refresher for ACBLscore.

## 2021.06.07

Table count at face-to-face clubs doubled again month over month.

Return to face-to-face. Short term actions. Table credit for limited games. Has to be same club number! Games of same class are separate games -- no table credit. Run unlimited sessions for remainder of 2021.

Allow 8 weeks of "Welcome Back" games at club championship rating, starting July 1st. Allow 2 weeks of "Super Welcome Back" games at upgraded club championship rating. Can also run regular club championship games and normal special games!

July 1st dropping multiplier to 1.25 from 1.50. Intend to eliminate it later.

## 2021.06.21

@@@ When we go face-to-face can some of the money placed in BBO be refunded? @@@ Official policy is no refunds. Can try BBO help.

@@@ No robots will be allowed in NAP qualifying games per 6/14/2021 revision. @ We can use robots but the pair will not qualify.

Longest Day dates went a bit off. Saturday mistake did not run as Longest Day but fixed. Also set up as $3 per table rather than $4.

BBO server update coming this week. Set convention card at the registration screen.

NAP games masterpoints OK but cannot Q.

Live for Clubs can hide results via a setting.

## 2021.07.05

Live For Clubs still an issue.

## 2021.07.19

Meeting cancelled.

## 2021.09.13

Visitor policy - has stayed the same for about a year, some clubs have issues with compliance, new policy launch soon.

Special events - have not figured out November yet.

Tournaments are back - paramount idea is safety; not planning on line regional events, Austin National is still on.

Swiss Team improvements - strats still not done, odd number of teams not handled still, allavail finished, ties finished. Not ready for prime time.

## 2021.10.04

Visitor policy has not changed. Working on a new version.

Tweak to include lists two months ago. Adding folks in recent face-to-face games.

Special events October virtual clubs appreciation week no extra fee and cannot run a GNT game.

Meeting structure: shorter and more often. Keep meeting to an hour. Twice a month but different times and days. Fifteen days after the Monday proposed.

The face-to-face upgraded club championships require 18 boards.

Swiss remains unready for prime time.

The $1.75 games have been around since 2004.

### Phil's notes

visitor policy is under review -- NB I will believe it when I see it.

Just in case anyone has any issues with OLDER MAC users, they will no
longer be able to sign in to BBO because of a server certificate issue.
I had 2 people that encountered that problem this weekend.

GNT is face to face only.

Glitter points! (Silver, Red, Gold, Platinum)

November two weeks upgraded club championships face to face. Carry over unused club championships and upgraded club championships from earlier.

Club sanction renewals for 2023. Will be canceling clubs. Do we need to sanction online sessions? Will not need separate sanctions for virrtual and face to face games in the same sancioned session.

### How many?

We have been running "Welcome Back" games but have not been disciplined about keeping track of how many games have been run. What's the easiest way to get a count of how many we've already run.

Chip, go to your results page... click on the little arrow to the right of RATING" and it will sort your games by their rating name. Scroll to Club Champ and Upgraded Club Champ … and you can easily view them. (Pay attention to the dates, because 2021 etc will be in there.)
